This is a python program to turn your seven segment
Generation I Delcom Engineering USB Numeric Display (USB ID 0fc5:1227)
into a clock.

Find the names of the displays on your machine (these names can be
directly passed to delcom-clock):

    ls /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbsevseg | grep :

Delcom-clock should use raw mode so that it can show space characters
rather than hyphens.

I have not tested this with a six digit 7 segment display because I
don't have one. If the kernel module only accepts 6 digits, then delcom-clock
with just use the last 6 digits of the text to be displayed.

This program can be found at http://github.com/stuart12/delcom-clock

Thanks to Harrison Metzger for the kernel driver for this device.
