This is a python program to turn your Delcom Engineering USB Numeric Display
(USB ID 0fc5:1227) into a clock.

I would like delcom-clock to exit as soon as the device is unplugged. I don't
know how to do this. I only seem to be able to find out that the device
has been removed when I write to it. Polling on the device does seem to give
me a wakeup when the device is removed. This is why delcom-clock continues
to write to the device even when it is off.

Delcom-clock should use raw mode so that it can show space characters rather
than hyphens.

I have not tested this with a six digit display because I don't have one.

Tested with kernel 2.6.32-3-amd64
